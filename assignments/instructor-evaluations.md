### Hello Class,

*It is **teaching evaluation** time!*

Monday, December 13th is the deadline to complete an evaluation for each of your instructors.

### Why do it?

**It is completely *anonymous*.**

I personally am interested in your feedback on the course so I can continue to improve the course and adjust it to student needs and backgrounds.

Teacher evaluations serve a number of important functions such as:

  - Improving classes by providing instructors feedback on their teaching.

  - Refining course requirements and design based on student feedback.

  - Helping future students make decisions about what courses and instructors are right for them.

  - Serving as supporting documentation in a faculty’s reappointment, tenure and promotion.

Teacher evaluation results are readily accessible at [www.hunter.cuny.edu/myprof][myprof].
