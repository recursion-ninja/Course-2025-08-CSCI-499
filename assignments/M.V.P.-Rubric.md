**Reminder:** The sylabus describes the Minimum Viable Product Presentation grading as follows:

> Presenting the exact MVP specifications is considered **B-grade** work (`20/25` points).

A score of `(20/25)` is coresponds to both a successful, mid-semester implmentation and a successful presentation.
To receive a score higher than `(20/25)`, a presentation displaying features beyond the M.V.P. specifications is required and recorded in the *Extra Features* category.
Additionally, a code review revealing exceptional software architecture may, to a lesser extent, earn a score higher than `(20/25)` recorded in the *Code Review* category.

(†) Score of `(0/8)` points in the *Extra Features* category coresponds to meeting, but not exceeding the M.V.P. expected features.
A Score of `(8/8)` coresponds presenting features which would be sufficient for a *Final* Product Presentation.

(‡) Score of `(2/4)` points in the *Code Review* category coresponds to the expected level of software architecture cleanliness.
A higher score coresponds to software architecture which exceeds expectations.
